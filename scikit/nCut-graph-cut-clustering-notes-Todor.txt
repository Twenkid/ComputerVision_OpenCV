Student Notes and excerpts from the paper by Todor Iliev Arnaudov


Many possible partitionings
Hierarchical partitions
High level further repartitioning
Merging
Graphs
Tree

Graph, grouping

"This suggests that image segmentation based on lowlevel
cues cannot and should not aim to produce a complete
final ªcorrectº segmentation. The objective should instead
be to use the low-level coherence of brightness, color, texture, or
motion attributes to sequentially come up with hierarchical
partitions. Mid- and high-level knowledge can be used to
either confirm these groups or select some for further
attention. This attention could result in further repartitioning
or grouping. The key point is that image partitioning is
to be done from the big picture downward, rather like a
painter first marking out the major areas and then filling in
the details"



nodes = i,j - points in the feature space
edge's weight = w(i,j)
w = similarity
sets V1, V2, ...
similarity in Vx is high
similarity between V1, V2, ... is low


1. What is the precise criterion for a good partition?
2. How can such a partition be computed efficiently?

Perceptual grouping is about extracting the global impressions of a scene
